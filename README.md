# Excel_bank_Loan_Project
This project involves the creation of a dynamic Excel dashboard from raw financial data to monitor and assess bank lending activities and performance. The dashboard provides insights into key loan-related metrics, helping in data-driven decision-making, tracking loan portfolio health, and identifying trends.

# Objectives

The main objectives of this project were to:

1)Calculate total loan applications and monitor MTD and MoM changes.
2)Track the total funded amount and analyze MTD and MoM changes.
3)Monitor the total amount received from borrowers for cash flow and repayment analysis.
4)Analyze loan performance metrics including loan approval rate, average loan amount, and default rates.
5)Conduct regional analysis of loan distribution and performance.
6)Segment customers based on employment length, income, and loan purpose for targeted analysis.

# Key Features
